# Snake
Snake game initially forked from 'supergoat'

If completing this not in conjunction with a community sprint, ask your friend to tell the tale about Hora and Tempus.

Ideas for making difficulty levels:
Change GAME_SPEED. (Reasonable bounds seems to be 50 to 150)
Add two snake parts when food is eaten
Start with alternating snake parts
